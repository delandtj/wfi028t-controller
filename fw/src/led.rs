//! Status LED: the DevKitC-1's on-board addressable RGB LED (WS2812-type) on
//! GPIO8, driven by RMT TX channel 0 through `esp-hal-smartled`.
//!
//! The rule here is that nothing on the capture path may ever wait for the LED.
//! Producers only touch atomics - [`flash`] is one `fetch_or` plus a `Signal`
//! poke - and the single [`led_task`] is the only code that talks to the RMT
//! peripheral. If the LED cannot be brought up at all, the task returns and the
//! sniffer carries on exactly as before.
//!
//! GPIO8 is a strapping pin, but it is also the board's LED data line: it is
//! only sampled at reset, so driving it afterwards is harmless.
//!
//! States (see the README table), in priority order:
//!
//! - Master mode with the heat pump not answering: red blink at ~1 Hz. This one
//!   wins over every WiFi state below, because a controller that is driving the
//!   bus and getting nothing back is the thing you want to see from the door.
//! - WiFi configured but not associated (also: booting, reconnecting): blue
//!   blink at ~2 Hz.
//! - Associated, no TCP client: steady dim amber.
//! - Associated, TCP client connected: steady dim green.
//! - WiFi not available in this build (or the radio refused to start): steady
//!   dim cyan.
//! - On every captured frame, a short flash over the steady colour: bright green
//!   for a good CRC, bright red for BAD_CRC/SHORT frames and UART errors.
//!
//! Panics do NOT turn the LED red: the panic handler comes from esp-backtrace
//! and the RMT channel is owned by the LED task, so colouring the LED from a
//! panic would mean replacing that handler (and losing the backtrace) for a
//! cosmetic win. Not done on purpose.
